# Teaching-Flow Agent with CrewAI

CrewAI is a powerful framework for building autonomous AI agents that work in collaboration. One of its core concepts is the **Flow Agent**, which allows developers to define a structured sequence of tasks that agents should follow.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Python 3.10+
- `crewai` installed (`pip install crewai`)
- OpenAI API key (or other LLM provider credentials)

## What is a Flow Agent?

A **Flow Agent** in CrewAI is designed to execute tasks in a **step-by-step sequence**, passing outputs from one task to the next. It is ideal for scenarios that need structured workflows, like content creation pipelines, research tasks, or data processing.

## Teaching-Flow Agent

### 1. Install CrewAI

```bash
pip install crewai
````

## Tips for Effective Flow Agents

* Ensure each task has a **clear description** and **output expectation**.
* Chain tasks logically â€“ each output should be usable as input for the next.
* Use `verbose=True` for debugging or learning purposes.

## Use Cases

* Content writing pipelines
* Research + summarization
* Multi-step data transformations
* Travel itinerary planning

## Summary

Flow Agents in CrewAI enable you to create structured, multi-step AI workflows. By defining tasks, assigning them to agents, and linking them in a flow, you can build powerful autonomous systems tailored to your specific goals.
